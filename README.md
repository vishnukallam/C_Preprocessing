# C Preprocessing
## Hi everyone 
### I am here to demonstrate how the preprocessed (.i) file is modified before and after including the header file in the program.
### When we execute the .c file .i file will be created this will is the first step in the compilation. This stage was done by the Prepeocesser not directly by the Compiler.
### This .i file is the perprocessed file this file is the main cause to remove the comments, adding the header file if we included in the programm, and all defined macros are expand in this phase.
